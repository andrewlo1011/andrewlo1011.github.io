## Building blocks of [Drewlo.cc](https://Drewlo.cc)

The followings are the building blocks of my blog:

__[Cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/)__

Cloudflare.com provides [CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/) feature to cache my site in edge locations. In addition to CDN, It offers a free [SSL](https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/) certificate. 

__[Jekyllrb](https://jekyllrb.com)__

I use jekyllrb and open source theme [jekyll-theme-chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) provided by Cotes Chung as the template of the blog. I love the simplicity of the theme.  It offers tags, Catagories, [Goggle Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) and [DISQUS](https://disqus.com/) integration. 

__[GitHub](https://github.com/andrewlo1011)__

GitHub is the repository and version control system of my blog. The static webpages generated by Jekyllrb are stored in [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

__Other Components__

Web analytics by [Goggle Analytics](https://analytics.google.com)
Comment and feedback by [DISQUS](https://disqus.com/)
Domain Registration by [Godaddy](https://godaddy.com)
