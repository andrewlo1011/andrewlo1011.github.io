## Buildling blocks of [Drew.vip](https://Drewlo.cc)

The followings are the building blocks of my blog:


1. [Cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/) 

Cloudflare.com provides [CDN](https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn/) feature to cache my site in edge locations. In addition to CDN, It offers a free [SSL](https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/) certificate. 

2. [Jekyllrb](https://jekyllrb.com)

I use jekyllrb and open source theme [jekyll-theme-chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) provided by Cotes Chung as the template of the blog. I love the simplicity of the theme.  It offers tags, Catagories, [Goggle Analytics](https://analytics.google.com) and [DISQUS](https://disqus.com/) integration. 

3. [GitHub](https://github.com/andrewlo1011)

GitHub is the repository and version control system of my blog. The static webpages generated by Jekyllrb are stored in [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

4. Other Components
